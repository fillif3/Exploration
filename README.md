# Exploration
I created this program (except util.py) during my studies. It allows a robot (pioneer p3-dx) to do a variety of tasks using ROS. The robot can explore closed space with avoiding obstacles. Using gmapping, it is possible to create a simple map of that space. Moreover, if a user has a map, the program can find the shortest path between actual position (to find an actual position, particle filter can be used) and chosen destination. The program can also make this path smoother. Lastly, the robot can move through the created trajectory with avoiding obstacles. Artificial potential fields algorithm was used to do so.
